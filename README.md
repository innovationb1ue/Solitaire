# Introduction

This project was a re-development of [VueSolitaire](https://github.com/silent-lad/VueSolitaire), 
by adding multiplayer part and a golang backend [SolitaireBackend](https://github.com/innovationb1ue/SolitaireBackend) written by me as well. 

This is a toy which I created to play with my girlfiend. You can simply set up the server and then have some competitive fun with your friend in solitaire game!
